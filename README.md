# Project Title: Image Classification #

## 1. Introduction ##

The purpose of this project is to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.


## 2. Objectives ##

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content

## 3. Data Set ##

The dataset for this project originates from the [102 Category Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) (Nilsback, and Zisserman, 2008)
